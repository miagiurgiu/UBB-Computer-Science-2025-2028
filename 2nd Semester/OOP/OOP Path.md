Very big dilemmas:
- why do we need stuff like & and * in C but in C++ we did not?

Address vs Value in C:
- in C there exist only pointers (addresses) and values (copies)
- if you want a function to modify a variable from the outside of that function, you give its address -> pointer -> &len
- since when calling you did &len, inside the function you do *len so that you can go to the value from that address and write the new value in there
